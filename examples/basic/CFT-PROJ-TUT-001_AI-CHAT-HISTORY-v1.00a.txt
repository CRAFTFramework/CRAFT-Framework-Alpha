# HANDOFF-INSTRUCTIONS - Session-to-session Continuity
# =========================================================


"""
This file facilitates session-to-session continuity through a structured
"Handoff" system where each AI chat session passes project context to the next.


For the Tutorial Project, handoffs should track:
- Which features have been explained
- User's progress level
- Any confusion points or repeated questions
- Successful exercises completed
