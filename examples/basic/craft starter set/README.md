# CRAFT Starter Set (/starter-set)

Welcome to the CRAFT Starter Set — A beginner-friendly introduction to the Configurable Reusable AI Framework Technology.

## 1) What it is

This `/starter-set` folder contains a complete, ready-to-use CRAFT project designed for absolute beginners. It demonstrates CRAFT's four-file architecture (Project Implementation, AI Chat History, Framework Spec, and Core Cookbook) with auto-initialization, helpful guidance, and example recipes. This project (CFT-PROJ-START-001) serves as both a learning tool and a template for creating your own CRAFT projects.

## 2) Why it's useful

The CRAFT Starter Set removes barriers to entry for newcomers to the framework:

- **Auto-initialization** triggers on any mention of "CRAFT" — no manual setup needed
- **Friendly teacher persona** provides patient, encouraging guidance without forcing tutorials
- **Flexible help system** adapts to your preferred learning style (quick/detailed/comprehensive)
- **Working example recipe** (HELLO_CRAFT) demonstrates recipe structure in action
- **Gentle error handling** encourages exploration without fear of mistakes
- **Session continuity** via structured handoffs, maintaining context across AI interactions

## 3) Install / Quick Start

No installation required — CRAFT runs entirely through Python-compatible text files shared with your AI assistant.

1. **Clone/download this repository** and locate the four CRAFT files:
starter-set/
├── CFT-PROJ-START-001_CRAFT-STARTER-SET-v1a.txt     # Project Implementation
├── CFT-PROJ-START-001_AI-CHAT-HISTORY-v1a.txt       # Conversation Continuity
├── CFT-FWK-COOKBK-CORE-v0825c7.txt                  # Core Cookbook (14 recipes)
└── [CFT-FWK-SPEC file - to be added]                # Framework Specification


2. **Attach all four files** to your AI chat session (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)

3. **Simply mention "CRAFT"** in your message — auto-initialization will handle the rest:
"Let's use CRAFT to build something"
"I want to learn about CRAFT"
"Begin CRAFT session"


4. **Say "HELP" anytime** to get assistance at your preferred detail level

5. **Try the example recipe**:
Execute HELLO_CRAFT_RECIPE with user_name="YourName"


**Tip:** The project includes placeholders for a 5th file (Beginner's Guide to CRAFT) which can be added as your reference grows.
