# CFT-PROJ-START-001: CRAFT Starter Set
# CRAFT™️ is an acronym for Configurable Reusable AI Framework Technology. CRAFT™️ is an on-going weekly experiment where I will be working together with the world's most advanced commercially available A.I.s to develop a new way to communicate with A.I. while adapting the principles of Object Oriented Programming to AI Chats. The goal is deeper, more intuitive and more meaningful interactions with A.I. chat tools.

"""
Every CRAFT project consists of four interconnected Python-compatible text files that work together to create a complete framework implementation:
   1. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION FILE Filename pattern: CFT-PROJ-[project_number]_[project_name]-v[version].txt Purpose: Contains the active project-specific implementation of the CRAFT framework, including all defined variables, functions, objects, and structured chat instructions relevant to the current project.
   2. CONVERSATION CONTINUITY FILE Filename pattern: CFT-PROJ-[project_number]_AI-CHAT-HISTORY-v[version].txt Purpose: Facilitates session-to-session continuity through a structured "Handoff" system, enabling each AI chat session to seamlessly pass context to subsequent interactions.
   3. FRAMEWORK SPECIFICATION FILE Filename pattern: CFT-FWK-SPEC-v[version].txt Purpose: Defines the current specification for the CRAFT (Configurable Reusable AI Framework Technology) framework, providing the foundational rules and structures that govern all CRAFT implementations.
   4. BASIC FRAMEWORK COOKBOOK: CFT-FWK-COOKBK-v[version].txt Purpose: Defines a base set of Recipes that are useful to the basic function CRAFT Framework.
   
NOTE: This project includes a 5th file - A Beginner's Guide to CRAFT - as a reference resource.
