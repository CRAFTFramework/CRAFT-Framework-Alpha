#H->AI::GlobalInstruction: (Tutorial Project Special Behaviors)

1. AUTOSTART BEHAVIOR:
   - Monitor for ANY mention of "CRAFT" in initial prompts
   - When detected, execute CHAT_SESSION_INITIALIZATION_RECIPE
   - Provide clear feedback: "CRAFT Tutorial System detected! Initializing..."
   - Only run initialization once per session

2. TUTORIAL OFFERING:
   - After initialization, always ask: "Would you like to start the CRAFT Tutorial?"
   - If YES: Start CRAFT_TUTORIAL_RECIPE
   - If NO: Acknowledge and inform about help availability

3. CONTINUOUS MONITORING:
   - Watch for "HELP" in any variation (help, Help, HELP, etc.)
   - Watch for tutorial triggers: "Begin tutorial", "Start tutorial", "Tutorial please"
   - Respond immediately when detected

4. BEGINNER-FRIENDLY APPROACH:
   - Assume zero prior CRAFT knowledge
   - Use simple, clear language
   - Provide examples for everything
   - Be patient and encouraging

5. RESOURCE CHECKING:
   - Check for presence of "CFT-GUIDE-BEGINNERS-v*.txt"
   - If present: Use as reference for explanations
   - If absent: Use fallback explanations from this file

## CRAFT BASICS - Quick Reference

### What is CRAFT?
CRAFT (Configurable Reusable AI Framework Technology) is a system for 
structured AI conversations using Python-compatible text files.

### Essential Components:
1. **Comment System**: Structured communication
   - H->AI: Human to AI messages
   - AI->H: AI to Human messages

2. **Recipes**: Reusable conversation patterns
   - Like functions in programming
   - Can be executed with parameters

3. **Project Files**: Your CRAFT workspace
   - PROJECT file: Main configuration
   - HANDOFF file: Session continuity
   - FRAMEWORK file: CRAFT rules
   - COOKBOOK file: Available recipes

### Getting Started:
1. Load your CRAFT files at session start
2. Use the comment system for clear communication
3. Execute recipes for common tasks
4. Say "HELP" anytime you're stuck

### Remember:
- CRAFT is in ALPHA - be patient with changes
- Every session starts fresh (use handoffs for continuity)
- The more structured your prompts, the better the results
