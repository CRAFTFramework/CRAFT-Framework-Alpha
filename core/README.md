# CRAFT Core

> Core files for the CRAFT (Configurable Reusable AI Framework Technology) framework.

## 1) What it is
The **core** directory contains the framework’s foundational files and conventions that power CRAFT’s “code‑as‑conversation” approach—bringing variables, functions, objects, and recipes to structured AI work. It is designed to be **Python‑compatible** text that AIs can load directly.

## 2) Why it’s useful
- **Consistency across sessions** — Standard files preserve rules and structure so outcomes don’t drift.
- **Reusability** — Variables, functions, and recipes eliminate repeated prompting.
- **Project continuity** — Clear separation between long‑term project state and short‑term handoffs keeps teams aligned.
- **Security & governance** — Core files encode licensing, security checks, and communication protocols up front.

## 3) Install / Quick Start
> Beginner-friendly steps to get you productive in minutes.
