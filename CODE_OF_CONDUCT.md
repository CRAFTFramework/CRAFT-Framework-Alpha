## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in the CRAFT Framework community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on the best interests of the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment, doxxing, or sustained disruption
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, flaming, or intentionally off‑topic comments
- Any behavior that violates applicable laws

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community health is managed by the **Maintainer**: **Rich Ketelsen** (primary contact below). The Maintainer is responsible for clarifying and enforcing this policy and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If the report concerns a potential conflict of interest with the Maintainer, the Maintainer will recuse from decisions where appropriate.

## Reporting

- **Primary contact (reports & questions):** rich.ketelsen@gmail.com  
- **Acknowledgement:** Best‑effort acknowledgement. The project is maintained part‑time and the Maintainer generally reviews reports on **Mondays**; response times may vary.

When reporting, please include:
- What happened, where, and when
- Links or screenshots if available
- Whether the incident is ongoing
- Any prior context that may help us understand the situation
- Your preferred level of confidentiality and whether you want follow‑up

Reports will be handled as confidentially as possible. Information is shared only as needed to investigate and resolve the issue.

## Enforcement (Short Summary)

Consequences may include one or more of the following, applied proportionally to severity and history:

1. **Correction** – Private or public clarification and request to stop.
2. **Warning** – Official warning noting the violation.
3. **Temporary Restriction** – Limited or suspended participation in community spaces.
4. **Permanent Restriction** – Removal from community spaces and/or project participation.

The Maintainer will explain which rule was violated, how the decision was reached, and what follow‑up (if any) is expected.

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was made in error, reply to the decision email with additional context. Appeals are reviewed by the Maintainer with consideration of new information.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the **Contributor Covenant**, version 2.1, and customized for a single‑maintainer, multi‑channel open‑source community. See: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/
